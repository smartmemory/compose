### COMP-OBS-TIMELINE — Decision timeline strip + dual-emit pipeline

**Why:** Wave 6 region ② per CONTRACT layout. Closes the orphaned `decisionEvent` broadcast that COMP-OBS-BRANCH has been emitting into the void since 2026-04-20, and adds two new event kinds (`phase_transition`, `iteration`) so the strip is populated immediately on first lifecycle interaction. Strip already renders `gate` and `drift_threshold` cards via the same `DecisionCard` component — zero code change here when GATELOG and DRIFT ship their emitters.

**Server (single emit choke point + dual-emit at every existing broadcast site):**
- `server/decision-event-emit.js` *(new)* — `emitDecisionEvent(broadcastMessage, event)` + per-kind builders (`buildPhaseTransitionEvent`, `buildIterationEvent`). Builder output byte-matches BRANCH's existing emit envelope (`cc-session-watcher.js:146-167`).
- `server/decision-event-id.js` — extended with `phaseTransitionDecisionEventId(featureCode, fromPhase, toPhase, timestamp)` and `iterationDecisionEventId(featureCode, loopId, stage)`. Same uuidv5/per-feature-namespace pattern as existing `branchDecisionEventId`. Deterministic — re-derive == identity.
- `server/lifecycle-phase-history.js` *(new)* — sole writer for `lifecycle.phaseHistory[]`, plugging `project_lifecycle_phasehistory_gap` (memory note). Entries carry BOTH the legacy shape (`phase`, `step`, `enteredAt`, `exitedAt`, `outcome`) consumed by `ItemDetailPanel.jsx`, `ContextPipelineDots.jsx`, and `session-routes.js`, AND the new shape (`from`, `to`, `outcome`, `timestamp`) consumed by snapshot derivation. Appending a successor closes out the prior entry's `exitedAt`.
- `server/decision-events-snapshot.js` *(new)* — `deriveDecisionEvents(state, featureCode)` walks `phaseHistory[]` + `iterationState` + `lifecycle.lifecycle_ext.branch_lineage.branches[]` to seed the strip on WS connect. Computes `sibling_branch_ids` per fork_uuid grouping (matches BRANCH live-emitter semantics — including self).
- `server/vision-routes.js` — dual-emit at 8 broadcast sites (lines 183, 237, 260, 283, 305 for phase transitions; 357, 414, 446 for iteration start/complete/abort; line 418 deliberately untouched — per-attempt `iterationUpdate` does not flood the strip).
- `server/vision-server.js` — `getVisionSnapshot` now attaches `decisionEventsSnapshot` to the hydrate envelope.

**Client (region ② render + store wiring):**
- `src/components/vision/DecisionTimelineStrip.jsx` *(new)* — 72px sticky band, full-width, horizontally scrollable, newest-right ordering. Filtered to current feature.
- `src/components/vision/DecisionCard.jsx` *(new)* — 160px card per CONTRACT layout.md §②: timestamp top-right, title, role chips (`IMPLEMENTER` / `REVIEWER` / `PRODUCER`), linked-run status dot.
- `src/components/vision/decisionTimelineLogic.js` *(new)* — pure helpers (`formatRelativeTime`, `kindIcon`, `kindColor`, `roleChipClass`, `sortAndFilterEvents`).
- `src/components/vision/useVisionStore.js` — `decisionEvents: []` slice + `setDecisionEventsSnapshot(arr)` and `appendDecisionEvent(ev)` (dedupe by id).
- `src/components/vision/visionMessageHandler.js` — handlers for `decisionEvent`, `decisionEventsSnapshot`, plus seeding from `hydrate.decisionEventsSnapshot`.
- `src/components/vision/VisionTracker.jsx` — strip mounted at top-of-tree.
- `src/components/vision/constants.js` — `DECISION_KINDS` map for color/icon/label.

**Reviews:** 2 Codex review rounds against the implementation. Round 1 surfaced three real bugs that tests had passed over: (a) `phaseHistory` writer used the new `{from, to, outcome, timestamp}` shape only — silently broke `ItemDetailPanel`, `ContextPipelineDots`, and `session-routes` legacy readers; (b) snapshot derivation read `item.lifecycle_ext` (top-level) instead of the production-real `item.lifecycle.lifecycle_ext`, so cold reconnect would have dropped all branch cards; (c) snapshot rebuilt branch events with hardcoded `sibling_branch_ids: []`, dropping fork context after refresh. All three fixed; round 2 added an executable assertion for sibling rehydration. REVIEW CLEAN at round 2 close.

**Tests:** 121 new tests (117 node:test + 10 vitest, plus regression tests for the three Codex fixes). Full suite: **1677 pass, 0 fail, 4 intentional skips** (siblings STATUS / GATELOG / LOOPS / DRIFT awaiting ship). Wave 6 contract-compliance suite un-skipped TIMELINE placeholder.



### COMP-OBS-CONTRACT — Wave 6 shared contract, locked

**Why:** Gates the rest of Wave 6 (Situational Awareness). Six sibling features (COMP-OBS-STATUS, TIMELINE, STEPDETAIL, LOOPS, GATELOG, DRIFT) now build against a single frozen schema + layout + integration-smoke spec, so cross-feature drift (the failure class that motivated `feedback_integration_review`) can't land silently.

**Schema (`docs/features/COMP-OBS-CONTRACT/schema.json` → v0.2.3):**
- Propagates the 2026-04-23 SURFACE → TIMELINE+STEPDETAIL split through `_consumers`. Emitter ownership restated: BRANCH→kind=branch, GATELOG→kind=gate, TIMELINE→kind=phase_transition + kind=iteration, DRIFT→kind=drift_threshold.
- `StatusSnapshot.drift_alerts[]` now a closed subschema that mandates `breached: true` (STATUS can no longer emit non-alert axes through the alerts field).
- Gate `DecisionEvent.metadata.gate_log_entry_id` promoted to required. Canonical join is the forward edge; `GateLogEntry.decision_event_id` remains nullable only as an emission-failure escape hatch, with reconciliation rule documented (gate_id + timestamp ±5s).

**Spec artifacts:**
- `design.md` *(new)* — unifying index, read order, versioning discipline, in-/out-of-scope for v1.
- `layout.md` — region ⑤ rewritten to describe the shipped `BranchComparePanelMount` at `ItemDetailPanel.jsx:419-422`; region ⑥ (DRIFT ribbon) re-anchored above BRANCH mount (the former "above chat input" anchor didn't exist in code); mobile-stacking and 50-branch-pagination claims relaxed to match shipped BranchComparePanel (no responsive breakpoint, no branch-picker UI in v1).
- `integration-test.md` — two-file ownership documented (BRANCH-slice integration + new contract-compliance); golden flow extended with `kind=drift_threshold` so Timeline exercises all five DecisionEvent kinds.
- `blueprint.md` *(new)* — file:line-verified plan with corrections table (wave-6-integration.test.js already existed; Playwright deferred; real-CC-in-tests a non-goal).
- `plan.md` *(new)* — ordered T1–T10 acceptance-gate plan.

**Code:**
- `compose/test/wave-6-contract-compliance.test.js` *(new)* — 30 tests, 5 intentional `test.skip()` placeholders (one per unshipped sibling, named after its feature code so `grep COMP-OBS-<CODE>` finds the un-skip line on landing). Covers: schema-load, dataset gate, per-fixture BranchOutcome round-trip (6 fixtures including `failed-branch` and `truncated` so state=failed is exercised), BranchLineage positive + unbound-branches negative, state=unknown shape, DecisionEvent all five kinds + gate-without-`gate_log_entry_id` negative + per-kind metadata `additionalProperties` closure negative, OpenLoop positive/resolved/non-UUID, 4 error-harness rows, 50-branch lineage + `pickInitialPair`.
- `compose/package.json` — new `test:wave-6` script runs both Wave 6 files as one suite.

**Tests:** 25 new tests (30 defined, 5 skipped). Full suite: 1558 pass, 0 fail, 5 intentional skips.

**Reviewed:** 3 Codex review rounds against the spec artifacts (6 findings → 3 follow-ups → REVIEW CLEAN), 2 Codex review rounds against the implementation (2 findings → 1 follow-up → implicit clean after state=unknown coverage added).



**Why:** First shipping feature of Wave 6 (Situational Awareness). Forge reads Claude Code's existing parent-pointer branch tree at `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` — no new fork mechanism, no new storage. Ships first because it's the structural validator that the CC JSONL assumption holds; failures here invalidate the branch-outcome shape the rest of the Wave 6 batch depends on.

**Producer (backend):**
- `server/schema-validator.js` *(new)* — ajv wrapper over `docs/features/COMP-OBS-CONTRACT/schema.json` v0.2.2. Used at the lineage-POST boundary and in tests.
- `server/cc-session-reader.js` *(new)* — parses a single CC session JSONL, builds a parent-pointer tree over non-sidechain records, classifies each leaf's state (`running` / `complete` / `failed` / `unknown`), derives BranchOutcome metrics per blueprint §6.5. Truncated files tolerated.
- `server/cc-session-feature-resolver.js` *(new)* — joins `cc_session_id` → `feature_code` via (1) `basename(transcriptPath)` match in `.compose/data/sessions.json`; (2) fallback probe of `docs/features/<CODE>/sessions/<cc_session_id>.*`; (3) unbound → null (counted in `stats.unbound_count`, never emitted per the contract's required `feature_code` rule).
- `server/decision-event-id.js` *(new)* — deterministic `uuidv5` event id keyed on `(feature_code, branch_id)` + pure `shouldEmit` dedupe helper. Prevents full-rescan replay on restart.
- `server/cc-session-watcher.js` *(new)* — orchestrator. Per-feature × per-session accumulator (so a feature with multiple CC sessions never has branches clobbered on POST), aggregated lineage POST, debounced `fs.watch` with polling fallback, persisted `emitted_event_ids` round-trip across restart.
- `server/vision-store.js` — `updateLifecycle` now preserves prior `lifecycle_ext` across partial-update callers (the 31 existing callsites, notably `feature-scan.js`, safely write non-extension fields without clobbering Wave 6 additions). New `updateLifecycleExt(id, key, value)` is the single public method Wave 6 features use to write extensions.
- `server/vision-routes.js` — new `POST /api/vision/items/:id/lifecycle/branch-lineage`, schema-validated at the boundary; emits `branchLineageUpdate` WebSocket event. Idempotent.
- `server/vision-server.js` — opt-in `CCSessionWatcher` wire-up. **Default OFF.** Enable via `capabilities.cc_session_watcher: true` in `compose.json` or `CC_SESSION_WATCHER=1` env var. When on, seeds emitted event ids from persisted lineage on startup (no replay), runs a full scan, then watches.

**Consumer (frontend):**
- `src/components/vision/BranchComparePanel.jsx` *(new)* — collapsed 1-liner (`N branches · last fork Xh ago · [Compare]`); expanded 2-column metric grid with inline `ArtifactDiff` below. Compare button disabled when <2 `state: complete` branches; mid-progress shows `X of N branches ready`. Metric rows pluggable via `extraMetricsForBranch` prop (future COMP-OBS-DRIFT injection point).
- `src/components/vision/branchComparePanelLogic.js` *(new)* — pure helpers (summary/age/number formatters + `pickInitialPair`) extracted for unit testing without a DOM.
- `src/components/vision/useVisionStore.js` — Zustand `selectedBranches: { [featureCode]: [branchIdA, branchIdB] }` slice + `setSelectedBranches` action. Session-local, not persisted.
- `src/components/vision/ItemDetailPanel.jsx` — mounts `<BranchComparePanel>` as the first child of the scroll body when `item.lifecycle.featureCode` is set.

**Dependencies:** `ajv` `^8.18.0`, `ajv-formats` `^3.0.1` — JSON Schema draft-07 + date-time/uuid formats, used at all contract boundaries.

**Tests:**
- `test/fixtures/cc-sessions/` *(new)* — 6 synthesized+scrubbed JSONL fixtures + multi-session dir + byte-deterministic `capture.js`. Covers linear, two-branch fork, three-branch fork, mid-progress, failed-branch (via `tool_result.is_error:true`), truncated.
- 9 new test files under `test/comp-obs-branch/` + `test/vision-store-server.test.js` + `test/wave-6-integration.test.js`. Coverage: schema boundaries (12), reader (24), resolver (9), event id (8), watcher (6), route (7), logic (27), store (11), integration (6) = 110 new tests.
- Integration test runs entirely on tmp dirs — never touches `~/.claude/projects/` or `$HOME`.

**Verified:**
- Full suite `node --test test/*.test.js test/comp-obs-branch/*.test.js`: **1522/1522 pass** (1515 pre-review + 7 added in response to Codex findings), zero regressions across the 31 existing `updateLifecycle` callsites.
- `npm run build` succeeds in ~8.5s.
- UI not manually verified in a browser (dev server was not started to avoid disrupting the active developer session). Vite dev server smoke via curl: `BranchComparePanel.jsx`, `ItemDetailPanel.jsx`, `branchComparePanelLogic.js`, `useVisionStore.js` all serve HTTP 200 with compiled JSX — import graph resolves cleanly.

**Codex review pass (2026-04-20):** six findings, five accepted + fixed, one deferred with rationale:
1. ✅ **Bug** — `parseJsonlSafe` silently dropped mid-line parse failures. Fixed: any unparseable line now flags `truncated=true`, and `running` leaves under a truncated session are downgraded to `unknown` (positive identifications on the leaf itself — `is_error`, `stop_reason: end_turn` — remain trustworthy).
2. 📎 **Deferred** — Codex flagged that `failed` branches get completion-only metrics (`turn_count`, `files_touched`, etc.) populated, citing per-field "Populated when state=complete" descriptions. The plan (T1 acceptance criteria) and the schema's `ended_at` description ("Populated when state is terminal (complete / failed). Null while running.") both codify "terminal = complete OR failed" for completion-only fields. Keeping implementation aligned with the plan. If COMP-OBS-CONTRACT wants stricter semantics, it needs a schema bump that unambiguously says "complete only" across all completion-only fields.
3. ✅ **Contract** — `final_artifact.path` was chosen at the reader before `feature_code` resolution, so a session touching multiple feature folders could attach another feature's artifact. Fixed: watcher re-filters `final_artifact` against `docs/features/<resolved feature_code>/` and nulls it when out-of-scope.
4. ✅ **Contract** — Branch-lineage route didn't verify `body.feature_code === item.lifecycle.featureCode`. Fixed: route rejects with 400 when the item has no `lifecycle.featureCode` or when `feature_code` mismatches.
5. ✅ **Race** — `_flush()` broadcast DecisionEvents before persisting the updated `emitted_event_ids`, so a crash between broadcast and POST could replay. Fixed: `_flush()` now stages ids in the lineage payload, POSTs first, and only commits ids to the in-memory dedupe set + broadcasts on POST success. On POST failure, the set is untouched and the next scan retries.
6. ✅ **Schema** — Production watcher path bypassed schema validation (direct `updateLifecycleExt`). Fixed: `vision-server.js`'s `postBranchLineage` callback now validates against `BranchLineage` and verifies the `feature_code`/`featureCode` match before persisting.

**Not in v1** (per feature.json): no new fork mechanism (users still fork via CC `Esc Esc` / rewind); no transcript-level side-by-side diff; no tool-call timeline; no cross-session ancestry; no mid-session fork UI in Forge. Read-only visualizer over CC's native state.

**Heuristic-in-v1 metrics:** `tests.passed/failed/skipped` parsed from `tool_result` stdout via a pytest/jest/vitest/mocha regex — exact where matchable, else `0`. `cost.usd` is `0` unless `CC_USD_PER_1K_INPUT` / `CC_USD_PER_1K_OUTPUT` env vars are set. `final_artifact.snapshot` is `null` (lazy-load via `path` deferred to v2).

### COMP-REACT19 — React 18.3.1 → 19.2.5

**Why:** Unblocks COMP-TUI-COCKPIT (ink 7.x requires React ≥19.2.0); also picks up `use()`, form actions, and ref-as-prop ergonomics for the app.

**Changes:**
- `package.json`: `react` `^18.3.1` → `^19.2.5`; `react-dom` `^18.2.0` → `^19.2.5` (aligned).

**Verified safe:**
- No `ReactDOM.render`/`hydrate`, no `propTypes`/`defaultProps` on function components, no string refs, no legacy context usage.
- Zero block-bodied `useMemo`/`useCallback` with implicit-undefined returns (breaking change #6 is a no-op here).
- `src/main.jsx` already uses `createRoot`; app is not wrapped in `<StrictMode>` (no double-invoke surfacing).
- `React.forwardRef` (61 call sites across 13 UI files) retained — still supported in React 19; ref-as-prop codemod deferred to a future cleanup.
- All React-consuming deps (`@radix-ui/*`, `@hello-pangea/dnd`, `@tanstack/react-virtual`, `react-markdown`, `lucide-react`, `ink`, `zustand`) compatible with React 19 at current pins.

**Tests:** 1420 tests pass (baseline unchanged); 10 integration tests pass; `npm run build` succeeds in 5.07s.

### T2-F5-CONSUMER-MERGE-STATUS-COMPOSE — close the T2-F5 arc

**Why:** T2-F5-COMPOSE-MIGRATE-WORKTREE landed with a known trade-off (W1): client-side merge conflicts halted the CLI via a throw, but the stream-writer closed with `buildStatus='complete'` because the throw bypassed the terminal `buildStatus='failed'` branch. The flow state also reported `merge_status='clean'` server-side — Stratum auto-advanced before Compose could report the real status. T2-F5-DEFER-ADVANCE (stratum-side) added the back-channel; this feature wires Compose up to it.

**Changes:**

- `lib/stratum-mcp-client.js`: new `parallelAdvance(flowId, stepId, mergeStatus)` method.
- `lib/build.js`: split `applyServerDispatchDiffs` into a pure `applyServerDispatchDiffsCore` (returns `{mergeStatus, conflictedTaskId, conflictError, appliedFiles}`) + a thin throwing wrapper preserving the legacy non-deferred contract. Specs that haven't opted into `defer_advance: true` keep the old throw-on-conflict semantics.
- `lib/build.js:executeParallelDispatchServer`: now branches on `pollResult.outcome?.status === 'awaiting_consumer_advance'`. Defer path calls Core + `parallelAdvance(mergeStatus)`, replaces the sentinel with the real advance result (flow advances with truth). Legacy path uses the throwing wrapper. Defensive "spec mispairing" branch: if sentinel arrives without `capture_diff: true`, call `parallelAdvance('clean')` to unblock the flow and emit an actionable `build_error`.
- `lib/build.js`: new exported `resolveBuildStatusForCompleteResponse(response)` helper. In the main loop's complete branch, `buildStatus` is now derived via this helper — returns `'failed'` when `response.output.merge_status === 'conflict'`, else `'complete'`. Narrow check (not `output.outcome === 'failed'`) to avoid flipping on unrelated failure-flavored completions.
- `pipelines/build.stratum.yaml`: `execute` step opts in with both `capture_diff: true` and `defer_advance: true`. Under `COMPOSE_SERVER_DISPATCH=1` this activates the new path; otherwise the spec flags are inert (consumer-dispatch runs the agents itself).

**Tests:** 10 new (1 client + 4 integration with real temp git repos + 5 buildStatus unit). **1407 total passing**, 0 fail.

**T2-F5 arc status:** CLOSED end-to-end. Server-side enforcement, Python connectors, Compose routing for both isolation modes, diff export, defer-advance, and consumer merge status all shipped. Remaining T2-F5 tickets (BRANCH, DEPENDS-ON, STREAM, OPENCODE-DISPATCH, CLAUDE-CANCEL, RESUME, LEGACY-REMOVAL) are quality-of-life enhancements, not correctness gaps.

### CodexConnector: swap opencode backend for the official `codex` CLI

**Why:** Codex review was broken for everyone — the opencode-backed path hit persistent auth/model-access issues. The official OpenAI `codex` CLI (`@openai/codex`) is the same primitive used by the `openai/codex-plugin-cc` Claude Code plugin and is the supported path going forward.

**Changes:**
- `server/connectors/codex-connector.js`: full rewrite. No longer extends `OpencodeConnector`; now spawns `codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox read-only -m <model> -C <cwd>` and translates its JSONL event stream (`item.completed` / `turn.completed`) into the shared connector envelope. `<model>/<effort>` suffix parses into `-c model_reasoning_effort=<effort>`.
- Supported model IDs unchanged (`CODEX_MODEL_IDS`). Auth via `codex login` (ChatGPT OAuth) or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- `OpencodeConnector` retained for non-Codex providers — only the Codex subclass was rewired.

**Setup:** `npm i -g @openai/codex` (or `brew install codex`), then `codex login`. See README.

**Tests:** Existing `test/codex-connector.test.js` (5 cases) passes. Live smoke test against `codex` returns assistant/usage/result events correctly.

### T2-F5-COMPOSE-MIGRATE-WORKTREE: Worktree Diff Consumption in Server-Side Dispatch

**Feature:** Extended T2-F5-COMPOSE-MIGRATE to accept `isolation: "worktree"` + `capture_diff: true` on server-dispatch. New `applyServerDispatchDiffs()` wrapper reads `ts.diff` from poll response and delegates to shared `applyTaskDiffsToBaseCwd` helper (extracted from consumer-dispatch). Both dispatch paths now merge through the same code. Client-side merge conflicts emit `build_error` and throw to halt CLI. Known trade-off: merge_status visibility gap until T2-F5-CONSUMER-MERGE-STATUS lands Stratum-side defer-advance (flow state stays advanced server-side; manual resume required).

**Changes:**
- `lib/build.js`: New `applyServerDispatchDiffs()` wrapper + extracted shared `applyTaskDiffsToBaseCwd()` helper from consumer-dispatch. Merge conflicts throw to halt CLI.
- `test/build.test.js`: 10 new tests (6 routing, 4 integration): worktree routing with `capture_diff`, diff application, conflict handling, merge failures

**Tests:** All new tests passing. Full suite: 1397 passing (10 new).

### T2-F5-COMPOSE-MIGRATE: Server-Side Parallel Dispatch for Read-Only Steps

**Feature:** Compose's `parallel_dispatch` branch now routes through Stratum's server-side `stratum_parallel_start` + `stratum_parallel_poll` when `COMPOSE_SERVER_DISPATCH=1` AND `isolation: "none"`. Code-writing paths (`isolation: "worktree"`) remain on consumer-dispatch pending T2-F5-DIFF-EXPORT. Poll loop correctly breaks on `outcome != null`, not `can_advance`, so failure-path `ensure_failed` / retry dispatches propagate correctly.

**Changes:**
- `lib/stratum-mcp-client.js`: Added `parallelStart()` and `parallelPoll()` client methods for server-side dispatch
- `lib/build.js`: Added `executeParallelDispatchServer()` executor function with routing check at top of `executeParallelDispatch()`
- `README.md`: Documented `COMPOSE_SERVER_DISPATCH` and `COMPOSE_SERVER_DISPATCH_POLL_MS` environment variables
- Test coverage: 15 new tests (2 client + 7 server + 6 routing), 1387 total passing

**Tests:** All new routing + server dispatch tests passing. Full suite clean.

### Test suite fixes (34 failures across 15 suites)

**Root causes fixed:**
- Pipeline YAML specs: removed `metadata` top-level key rejected by stratum-mcp 0.1.0; removed `retries` on flow steps (not allowed per stratum schema)
- Pipeline spec: fixed `$.steps.execute.output.files_changed` reference (parallel_dispatch output uses `tasks` key)
- `visionMessageHandler`: test mocks missing new setters (`setSpawnedAgents`, `setAgentRelays`, `setIterationStates`, `setFeatureTimeline`, etc.) added in recent features
- `settings-store`: tests updated for `defaultView` change from `'attention'` to `'graph'`
- `selective-rerun`: tests updated to include `debug-discipline` in BASELINE_LENSES (added by COMP-DEBUG-1)
- `parallel-dispatch`: tests searched inline branch but code was refactored to `executeParallelDispatch()` function
- `project-config`: test imported removed `TARGET_ROOT` export, updated to `getTargetRoot()`
- `build-dag`: deduplicate entries by code to handle ROADMAP.md summary tables that repeat feature codes
- `vision-store`: gate labels updated to match `GATE_STEP_LABELS` constants (`'Review Design'` not `'design gate'`)
- `init`: test expected `stratum` skill but source only ships `compose` skill
- `proof-run`: mock connector updated for new pipeline steps (triage, merge, lens tasks, ship plan_items)

### COMP-DEBUG-1: Debug Discipline Engine (design)

**Feature design and pipeline enhancement for disciplined bug resolution.**

Derived from SmartMemory weekly retro analysis (132 commits, 4:1 fix:feat ratio). Four anti-patterns identified and codified:

1. **Fix-chain detection** — git analysis detects repeated edits to same file/function across commits, signals thrashing vs. root-cause fixing
2. **Trace-before-fix enforcement** — `diagnose` step now requires `trace_evidence` postcondition (actual command output, not prose assumptions)
3. **Cross-layer grep audit** — automatic scope expansion when diagnose detects provider switches, field renames, or config changes spanning repos
4. **Attempt counting with escalation** — hard stop on visual/layout bugs at attempt 2, cross-agent handoff to break "one more tweak" loops

**Pipeline changes:**
- `bug-fix.stratum.yaml`: 6 → 8 steps (added `scope_check` and `retro_check`)
- New contracts: `TraceEvidence`, `DiagnoseResult`, `ScopeResult`, `RetroCheckResult`
- `diagnose` step now has `ensure:` postconditions requiring trace evidence

**Docs:**
- `docs/features/COMP-DEBUG-1/design.md` — full feature design
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — added to Phase 7 (Trusted Pipeline Harness)

### COMP-IDEABOX Batch 3: Advanced Features (Items 184, 186, 187, 188, 189)

**Item 184: Lifecycle integration**
- **build.js:** after each agent step, scans output text for "we should/could/might" patterns and emits `idea_suggestion` stream events (hints only, nothing auto-filed).
- **bin/compose.js:** `compose new --from-idea <ID>` flag pre-populates intent from an ideabox entry's title + description + cluster, skips duplicate questionnaire fields.
- **AttentionQueueSidebar.jsx:** "Ideas" section below the attention queue showing untriaged idea count. Click navigates to the ideabox view.

**Item 186: Discussion threads**
- **lib/ideabox.js:** `parseIdeabox` and `serializeIdeabox` support inline discussion entries (`**Discussion:**` block with `- [date] author: text` entries). Discussion field parsed to `[{ date, author, text }]`.
- **lib/ideabox.js:** `addDiscussion(parsedData, ideaId, author, text)` mutation helper.
- **server/ideabox-routes.js:** `POST /api/ideabox/ideas/:id/discuss` endpoint.
- **bin/compose.js:** `compose ideabox discuss <ID> "<comment>"` subcommand.
- **IdeaboxView.jsx:** discussion thread rendered in detail panel; inline input to add comments.
- **useIdeaboxStore.js:** `addDiscussion` and `updateIdea` actions.

**Item 187: Impact/effort matrix**
- **lib/ideabox.js:** `effort` (S|M|L) and `impact` (low|medium|high) fields added to idea schema. Parsed from `**Effort:**` and `**Impact:**` lines.
- **server/ideabox-routes.js:** PATCH allows `effort` and `impact` fields.
- **IdeaboxMatrixView.jsx (new):** 2x2 scatter plot with Quick Wins / Big Bets / Fill-ins / Money Pits quadrants. Unassigned tray with inline EffortImpactForm. Dot colors by cluster.
- **IdeaboxView.jsx:** "Cards | Matrix" tab toggle in header.

**Item 188: Roadmap graph integration**
- **GraphView.jsx:** "Ideas" toggle (default off). When on, renders idea nodes as dashed amber circles connected via dashed edges to their `mapsTo` feature targets.

**Item 189: Source analytics + digest dashboard**
- **IdeaboxAnalytics.jsx (new):** collapsible analytics section in header — source breakdown bars, NEW→DISCUSSING→PROMOTED status funnel with kill rate, cluster health with promotion rate. Pure derived computation from store data.

- **Tests:** 68 tests, all passing. New suites: discussion parsing, addDiscussion, effort/impact fields, resurrectIdea.

### COMP-OBS-GATES: Tiered Gate Evaluation (Wave 4)

- **gate-tiers.js (new):** 5 tiers (T0 schema → T1 lint → T2 tests → T3 llm-review → T4 cross-model) with cost estimates. `classifyStepAsTier()` maps pipeline steps. `evaluateTiers()` short-circuits on first failure, tracks cost saved from skipped tiers.
- **build.js:** Accumulates tier results per step, emits `gate_tier_result`/`gate_tier_failed`/`gate_tier_summary` events, persists savings to `.compose/data/gate-savings.json`.
- **ContextStepDetail.jsx:** `TierPipeline` component with colored dots (green=pass, red=fail, gray=skipped), cost-saved badge, click-to-expand.
- 14 tests, all passing.

### COMP-QA: Diff-Aware QA Scoping (Wave 4)

- **qa-scoping.js (new):** `mapFilesToRoutes()` — framework-aware file→route mapper supporting Next.js (pages/app), Express, React Router, explicit routes.yaml config. React Router filename pattern takes precedence over routes/ directory (avoids misclassifying `AuthRoute.tsx`).
- **classifyRoutes():** splits into affected vs adjacent via path-prefix matching.
- **detectDevServer():** probes ports 3000/3001/4000/5173/8080 with AbortController timeout.
- **isDocsOnlyDiff():** flags builds where only docs/config changed.
- **build.js:** Emits `qa_scope` event before coverage dispatch. Persists `filesChanged` to feature.json for CLI inspection.
- **bin/compose.js:** `compose qa-scope <featureCode>` command reads feature's filesChanged and prints mapped routes.
- 39 tests, all passing.

### COMP-HEALTH: Quantified Quality Score (Wave 4)

- **health-score.js (new):** 6-dimension weighted score (test_coverage 25%, review_findings 25%, contract_compliance 15%, runtime_errors 15%, doc_freshness 10%, plan_completion 10%). Missing dimensions re-normalized out (no penalty). `computeCompositeScore()` returns score + breakdown + missing list.
- **health-history.js (new):** Append-only `.compose/data/health-scores.json`. `getTrend()` returns improving/declining/stable.
- **build.js:** Collects signals per phase (test_coverage from coverage_check, review_findings from parallel_review, plan_completion from ship, runtime_errors from violations, doc_freshness from staleness check, contract_compliance from ensure pass/fail tracking). Emits `health_score` event at build end. Persists to history.
- **settings-store.js:** `health.enabled`, `health.gate_threshold`, `health.weights` config. Validation: threshold 0-100, weights sum 1.0.
- **Enforcement:** When gate_threshold is set and score < threshold, build status downgraded to 'failed'.
- **ContextStepDetail.jsx:** Health Score panel with big color-coded number, trend arrow, per-dimension mini bars.
- **App.jsx:** Wires tierEvents and healthEvents from activeBuild to ContextStepDetail.
- 55 tests, all passing.

**Codex fixes:** health threshold now enforces via build status downgrade, App.jsx wires tier/health events to ContextStepDetail, filesChanged persisted to feature.json for qa-scope command, contract_compliance dimension now populated from ensure pass/fail tracking, React Router filename detection precedes routes/ dir check.

### STRAT-TIER: Model Tier Routing (Wave 4)

- **agent-string.js:** Extended parser to support `provider:template:tier` format. `parseAgentString()` returns `{ provider, template, tier }`. `resolveAgentConfig()` resolves tier → modelID.
- **model-tiers.js (new):** MODEL_TIERS map (critical → Opus, standard → Sonnet, fast → Haiku). `resolveTierModel()` lookup.
- **agent-chains.js (new):** Chain presets (plan-execute-review, review-fix, security-audit). `applyChain()` rewrites agent strings to include tier so runtime actually routes.
- **build.js:** defaultConnectorFactory passes resolved model via both `model` and `modelID` for cross-connector compatibility. Emits `step_model` stream events with tier + modelID.
- **build.stratum.yaml:** Targeted tier assignments — blueprint → critical, ship → critical, run_tests → fast. Defaults unchanged.
- 46 tests (model-tiers + agent-string extensions).

### COMP-OBS-COST: Token and Cost Tracking (Wave 4)

- **model-pricing.js (new):** Per-model token pricing (Opus $15/$75, Sonnet $3/$15, Haiku $1/$5 per MTok). `calculateCost()` with prefix matching for dated variants.
- **claude-sdk-connector.js:** Extracts usage from SDK result messages, yields `usage` events.
- **opencode-connector.js:** Forwards `step_finish` cost/token data as `usage` events (previously logged to stderr only).
- **result-normalizer.js:** Accumulates usage per step, calculates cost_usd via `calculateCost`, returns `{ text, result, usage }`, forwards per-step usage to streamWriter.
- **build-stream-writer.js:** `writeUsage()` emits `step_usage` events. `close()` accepts cost totals for `build_end`.
- **build.js:** Accumulates `buildCostTotals`. Includes tokens/cost on `build_step_done`. Emits cumulative totals on `build_end`. Persists to active-build.json so resumed builds seed correctly.
- **build-stream-bridge.js:** Passes through cost fields on build_step_done, build_end, and new step_usage event type.
- **opsStripLogic.js:** `formatCost()` helper. Active build entry shows `· $0.42` when cost > 0.
- **ContextStepDetail.jsx:** Per-step cost row + sortable breakdown table (most expensive step highlighted).
- 27 tests (model-pricing + cost-tracking).

**Codex fixes:** Chain presets now actually rewrite agent strings (were inert). Resumed builds seed cost totals from active-build.json (were zero-reset). Tier model passed as both `model` and `modelID` for Codex+Claude connector compat.

### COMP-IDEABOX: Product Idea Capture & Triage (Wave 3) — Batches 1+2

**Batch 1 (Backend + CLI):**
- **lib/ideabox.js (new):** pure markdown parser/writer. parseIdeabox/serializeIdeabox round-trip, addIdea, promoteIdea, killIdea, resurrectIdea, setPriority, addDiscussion, loadLens. Handles SmartMemory canonical format.
- **server/ideabox-routes.js (new):** REST API — GET, POST, PATCH, /promote, /kill, /resurrect, /discuss. PATCH rejects status mutations (must use /promote or /kill).
- **server/ideabox-cache.js (new):** mtime-invalidated JSON cache for fast UI queries.
- **bin/compose.js:** `compose init` scaffolds `docs/product/ideabox.md`. `compose ideabox` subcommands: add, list, promote, kill, pri, triage, discuss. Respects `paths.ideabox` and `paths.features` from compose.json.
- 48 parser/CLI tests.

**Batch 2 (Core Web UI):**
- **IdeaboxView.jsx (new):** main view with digest header, filter bar (tag/status/priority/search), priority lanes, drag-and-drop, click-to-detail panel, graveyard.
- **IdeaboxTriagePanel.jsx (new):** modal triage flow with keyboard shortcuts, similarity hints, progress.
- **IdeaboxPromoteDialog.jsx (new):** 3-step wizard (feature code → preview → confirm).
- **useIdeaboxStore.js (new):** Zustand store with WS-driven hydration.
- ViewTabs registers ideabox tab; App.jsx routes it.
- 24 store tests.

**Batch 3 (Advanced + Integrations):**
- **Discussion threads:** parse/serialize, addDiscussion endpoint, CLI `compose ideabox discuss`, detail panel thread UI.
- **Effort/impact matrix:** schema fields with enum validation, IdeaboxMatrixView.jsx (2x2 scatter with quadrants, unassigned tray).
- **Graph integration:** GraphView "Ideas" toggle renders idea nodes as dashed amber circles connected to mapsTo features. Nodes carry status='idea' for handler compatibility.
- **Source analytics:** IdeaboxAnalytics.jsx — source breakdown bars, status funnel, cluster health.
- **Lifecycle integration:** build.js scans agent output for "we should/could" patterns, emits idea_suggestion stream events. AttentionQueueSidebar shows untriaged count. `compose new --from-idea <ID>` pre-populates intent.
- 20 additional tests (discussion, addDiscussion, effort/impact, resurrect).

**Codex fixes:** REST promote now creates feature folder (CLI parity), enum validation on effort/impact, idea graph nodes interactive, idea_suggestion events bridged to UI.

92 total tests, all passing.

### COMP-CTX: Ambient Context Layer (Wave 3)

- **compose init:** scaffolds `docs/context/` with tech-stack.md, conventions.md, decisions.md. Path configurable via `compose.json` `paths.context`.
- **step-prompt.js:** ambient context injected into every agent prompt as `## Project Context`. Cached per-build, invalidated after decision log append.
- **staleness.js:** `checkStaleness()` reads `<!-- phase: ... -->` markers from artifacts, flags stale files in gate context.
- **Decision log:** gate outcomes auto-appended to decisions.md with date, feature, step, outcome, rationale.
- 33 tests, all passing.

### COMP-CAPS-ENFORCE: Runtime Violation Detection (Wave 3)

- **result-normalizer.js:** `onToolUse` callback tap on tool_use events — passive, doesn't change event flow.
- **capability-checker.js:** `checkCapabilityViolation()` compares tools against agent template. Violation (disallowed) vs warning (not in allowedTools).
- **build.js:** violations checked in both main loop and child flow steps. Logged to stream + console.
- **settings-store.js:** `capabilities.enforcement` setting — `log` (default) or `block`. Block mode fails the step on violation.
- 11 tests, all passing.

### COMP-TEST-BOOTSTRAP: Test Framework Bootstrap (Wave 3)

- **test-bootstrap.js:** `detectTestFramework()` checks config files + package.json deps. `scaffoldTestFramework()` creates vitest/jest/pytest/go/rust test setup.
- **build.js:** before coverage step, detects framework; if missing, scaffolds then annotates step intent for golden flow generation.
- **Ship step:** uses detected test command instead of hardcoded `npm test`.
- 25 tests, all passing.

### COMP-OBS-SURFACE + COMP-OBS-STREAM (Wave 3)

- **OBS-SURFACE:** Items 146, 148, 150 already implemented. Item 192 (live budget counters): OpsStrip shows "review 3/5, 2:34/15:00" during active iterations with live elapsed timer.
- **OBS-STREAM:** Items 145, 151-152 already implemented. Bridge mapping, ToolResultBlock, verbose gating all in place.

### COMP-UX-3: Workflow Approachability (Wave 3)

- **Scaffold defaults (137):** `compose feature` detects language, test framework, counts existing features. Pre-populates profile in feature.json (needs_prd, needs_architecture, etc.).
- **Conversational gates (138):** `buildRecommendation()` derives 1-sentence summary + recommended action from artifact assessment. Enter key defaults to recommendation. "d" shows full details. Web UI RecommendationBadge above gate actions.
- **Status narration (139):** 1-line console summaries after each step, gate resolution, and iteration. Full detail still in stream events.

### STRAT-REV-7: Cross-Model Adversarial Synthesis (Wave 2)

- **review-lenses.js:** `classifyDiffSize()` (small/medium/large by file count) and `shouldRunCrossModel()` gate.
- **build.js:** `runCrossModelReview()` — after Claude lenses complete on large diffs (≥9 files), dispatches Codex review, parses string findings, runs Claude synthesis agent to classify CONSENSUS/CLAUDE_ONLY/CODEX_ONLY. Fail-open: Codex errors return original result.
- **Opt-out:** `opts.skipCrossModel`, `COMPOSE_CROSS_MODEL=0` env var, graceful skip when Codex unavailable.
- No pipeline YAML changes — all orchestration in build.js.
- 29 tests (13 diff-size + 16 cross-model), all passing.

### COMP-DESIGN-2: Compose New Integration (Wave 2)

- Already implemented in prior session. `compose new` detects `docs/design.md`, appends to intent, skips questionnaire. Each pipeline step receives design doc via `$.input.intent`.

### COMP-BUDGET: Iteration Budget Enforcement (Wave 1)

- **vision-routes.js:** Wall-clock timeout enforcement (checked at each report, configurable per loop type), action count ceiling (accumulated from agent reports), auto-abort with structured outcomes (`timeout`, `action_limit`).
- **budget-ledger.js:** Cumulative cross-session budget tracking in `.compose/data/budget-ledger.json`. `recordIteration()` called from both report and abort routes. `checkCumulativeBudget()` blocks iteration start when cumulative limits exceeded (429).
- **settings-store.js:** Per-loop-type settings: `iterations.review.timeout` (15min default), `iterations.coverage.timeout` (30min), `iterations.review.maxTotal` (20), `iterations.coverage.maxTotal` (50).
- **visionMessageHandler.js:** Client handles `timeout` and `action_limit` outcomes with distinct messages.
- 15 tests, all passing.

### HOOK-CACHE: Read Cache Hook (Wave 1)

- **read-cache.py:** PreToolUse hook on Read. Per-agent mtime + line-range tracking. Blocks redundant reads of unchanged files with covered ranges. Merges overlapping intervals. Metrics to `stats.json`.
- **read-cache-invalidate.py:** PostToolUse hook on Edit/Write/MultiEdit. Invalidates cache entry for modified file.
- **read-cache-compact.py:** PreCompact hook. Clears entire session cache (context no longer has the content).
- **hooks.json:** Registered all three hooks, replacing old `read-cache.sh`.
- 15 tests, all passing.

### COMP-PLAN-VERIFY: Plan-Diff Verification (Wave 1)

- **plan-parser.js:** Agent-side helper — `parsePlanItems()` extracts checkbox items with file paths and critical flags, `matchItemsToDiff()` classifies done/missing/extra.
- **spec.py:** `plan_completion(plan_items, files_changed, threshold=90)` ensure builtin. Division-by-zero guard. Critical missing items → plain string violations. Below threshold → violation with percentage.
- **executor.py:** Registered `plan_completion` in ensure sandbox.
- **build.stratum.yaml:** Ship step ensure clause: `plan_completion(result.plan_items, result.files_changed)`. Ship step intent updated to instruct agent to extract plan items.
- 12 Python + 16 JS tests, all passing.

### STRAT-IMMUTABLE: Spec Immutability During Execution (Wave 1)

- **Stratum executor:** `spec_checksum` on FlowState — SHA-256 of parsed FlowDefinition computed at flow start, verified at every `stratum_step_done` and `stratum_parallel_done`. Detects in-memory spec mutation. Checksum persisted/restored across MCP restarts.
- **build.js Layer 2:** Pipeline file hash and policy hash captured at build start. `verifyPipelineIntegrity()` re-reads YAML from disk before each step transition — detects on-disk tampering. `verifyPolicyIntegrity()` hashes settings.json policies before gate resolution — detects gate criteria weakening.
- 9 Python tests + 7 JS tests, all passing.

### COMP-AGENT-CAPS: Agent Capability Profiles (Wave 1)

- **agent-templates.js:** 4 built-in profiles — `read-only-reviewer` (Read/Grep/Glob only), `implementer` (full access), `orchestrator` (no Edit/Write), `security-auditor` (Read/Grep/Glob/Bash).
- **agent-string.js:** Centralized `parseAgentString("claude:read-only-reviewer")` → `{ provider, template }` + `resolveAgentConfig()` for full resolution with tool restrictions.
- **claude-sdk-connector.js:** Accepts `allowedTools`/`disallowedTools`, passes to SDK. Falls back to `preset: claude_code` when no restrictions (backward compat).
- **build.js:** `defaultConnectorFactory` resolves agent string through template registry. Emits `capability_profile` stream events.
- **build.stratum.yaml:** Review sub-flow steps use `claude:orchestrator` (triage, merge) and `claude:read-only-reviewer` (lens dispatch).
- 28 tests, all passing.

### COMP-TRIAGE: Task Tier Classification (Wave 1)

- **triage.js:** Pure file analysis — counts paths in plan/blueprint, detects security/core paths, assigns tier 0-4 and build profile (`needs_prd`, `needs_architecture`, `needs_verification`, `needs_report`).
- **build.js integration:** Triage runs before `stratum_plan()`, mutates `skip_if` on skippable steps based on profile. Cached in feature.json with mtime-based invalidation.
- **CLI:** `compose triage <feature>` standalone command. `compose build --template <name>` and `--skip-triage` flags.
- No new pipeline templates — reuses existing `build.stratum.yaml` with `skip_if` toggling.
- 13 tests, all passing.

### COMP-DESIGN-1c: Live Design Doc (Wave 0)

- **DesignDocPanel.jsx** (new): Context panel component showing a live markdown preview of the design document as it builds from decisions. Preview mode (react-markdown + remark-gfm) and edit mode (monospace textarea). Manual edits survive across assistant turns. "Reset to auto-generated" rebuilds from current decisions.
- **designSessionState.js**: Added `buildDraftDoc(messages, decisions)` — constructs markdown draft from problem statement + active decisions + open threads. Added `buildTopicOutline(messages, decisions)` — extracts decided topics for the research sidebar.
- **useDesignStore.js**: New state fields (`draftDoc`, `docManuallyEdited`, `researchItems`, `topicOutline`). Draft rebuilds on each assistant turn unless manually edited. Manual edit state preserved across rehydration.
- **design-routes.js**: `POST /api/design/complete` accepts optional `draftDoc` body field — uses human-edited draft as seed for final LLM polish pass instead of generating from scratch.
- **App.jsx**: Context panel auto-shows DesignDocPanel when design view is active.

### COMP-DESIGN-1d: Research Sidebar (Wave 0)

- **DesignSidebar.jsx**: Added tab bar (Decisions / Research) with count badges. Existing decision log under Decisions tab. Research tab shows live research activity.
- **ResearchTab.jsx** (new): Three collapsible sections — Topic Outline (decided/open topics), Codebase References (Read/Grep/Glob tool uses with file paths), Web Searches (queries + summaries). Live updates as research events stream in.
- **design-routes.js**: Broadcasts `research` and `research_result` SSE events from `tool_use` and `tool_use_summary` events during design conversations. Unique `tu-N` IDs for reliable event correlation.
- **useDesignStore.js**: SSE handlers for research events with ID-based correlation. Research items accumulate across the full session.
- 38 design tests, all pass. 8 new test cases for `buildDraftDoc` and `buildTopicOutline`.

## 2026-03-28

### STRAT-REV: Parallel Multi-Lens Review (1-4, 6)

- **Stratum:** Added `isolation: "none"` to IR v0.3 schema (`spec.py`) for read-only parallel_dispatch tasks. 2 new tests.
- **Lens library:** `lib/review-lenses.js` — 4 lens definitions (diff-quality, contract-compliance, security, framework) with confidence gates and false-positive exclusions. `triageLenses()` activates lenses based on file patterns. 10 tests.
- **Pipeline:** `pipelines/build.stratum.yaml` — new contracts (LensFinding, LensTask, LensResult, TriageResult, MergedReviewResult), `parallel_review` sub-flow (triage → parallel lens dispatch → merge), main flow review step wired to `parallel_review`.
- **Build.js:** Review timeout bumped to 15min, added triage (2min) and merge (3min) timeouts. `isolation: "none"` path verified for read-only tasks.
- **Fix loop:** Parent-level ensure/retry drives the fix loop — ensure fails → build.js claude fix → whole sub-flow re-invoked with fresh triage/lenses/merge.
- STRAT-REV-5 (selective re-review) complete: sidecar `.compose/prior_dirty_lenses.json` written on review ensure_failed, triage reads it on retry. STRAT-REV-7 (cross-model synthesis) deferred.

### COMP-UI-6: Polish and Teardown

- `server/agent-server.js`: 5s interrupt escalation timer for SDK sessions
- `server/agent-registry.js`: getRunning() and updateStatus() methods
- `lib/build.js`: .owner file on worktree creation, disk quota check (500MB default)
- UI: kill button per agent tab, silence warning yellow dot, agentKilled terminal state
- 16 tests (agent-health: 10, worktree-gc: 6)

### COMP-PIPE-1-3: Pipeline Authoring Loop

- 4 new pipeline templates: bug-fix (6 steps), refactor (7), content (4), research (3)
- Metadata blocks on all 7 templates (id, label, description, category, steps, estimated_minutes)
- `server/pipeline-routes.js`: template listing, spec fetch, draft CRUD with draftId concurrency, approve/reject with safe lifecycle

- Version-aware step derivation (v0.1 flows + v0.3 workflow)
- Approved specs written to `.compose/data/approved-specs/` (not template library)
- 18 tests for pipeline-routes

- Agent Lifecycle Control: interrupt, health monitoring, resource limits, worktree GC
- Agent Coordination: parent-child RPC, inter-task coordination, message ordering
- Merge & Recovery: conflict recovery strategies, graceful degradation with retry
- Registry & Observability: rich queries, structured metrics, dependency validation
- Agent Templates & Parent Skills: template library, capability registry, root parent
  orchestration skill, parallel dispatch skill, persistent state machine

### COMP-UX-11: Feature Event Timeline

- Collapsible right panel on Dashboard showing chronological feature lifecycle events
- 5 event categories: Phase, Gate, Session, Iteration, Error — each with distinct icons and severity colors
- Historical hydration from sessions.json + gates; live updates via WebSocket
- Virtualized scrolling (`@tanstack/react-virtual`) for large event histories
- Filter chips to narrow by event category
- Added client-side handlers for previously unhandled `lifecycleStarted` and `lifecycleTransition` WebSocket messages

## 2026-03-16

### COMP-DESIGN-1: Interactive Design Conversation

- **Design tab** in cockpit header — new view for interactive product design conversations with the LLM
- **Decision cards** — LLM presents options as clickable cards with recommendations; cards render from inline ` ```decision ``` ` JSON blocks in markdown
- **Design sidebar** — running decision log replacing AttentionQueueSidebar when Design tab is active; supports decision revision
- **Session management** — one session per scope (product or feature), persisted to `.compose/data/design-sessions.json`, survives page reloads
- **SSE streaming** — real-time LLM response streaming via session-scoped Server-Sent Events with in-flight dispatch guard
- **Design doc generation** — "Complete Design" action writes structured design doc to `docs/design.md` (product) or `docs/features/{code}/design.md` (feature)
- **`compose new` integration** — detects existing design doc and uses it as enriched intent, skipping the questionnaire
- **Security hardening** — prototype pollution protection, input validation, completed session guards, optimistic rollback

## 2026-03-15

### COMP-UX-1d: Ops Strip

- **OpsStrip component** (`src/components/cockpit/OpsStrip.jsx`): persistent 36px bar between main workspace and agent bar, surfaces active builds, pending gates, and recent errors as horizontally-scrollable pills
- **OpsStripEntry component** (`src/components/cockpit/OpsStripEntry.jsx`): pill component with design-token colors (blue/amber/red/green HSL), inline gate approve button, dismiss button for errors
- **Pure logic module** (`src/components/cockpit/opsStripLogic.js`): `deriveEntries()` and `filterRecentErrors()` — testable without React
- **recentErrors derived state** in `useVisionStore`: filters `agentErrors` to 60s window (max 5), recomputes on 10s interval for reactive aging
- **Entry animations**: slide-in on enter, flash green on build complete (2s), fade-out on dismiss
- **Visibility**: hidden when `activeView === 'docs'`, hidden when no entries
- **Build key uniqueness**: keyed by flowId/startedAt to prevent dismissal collision across builds for the same feature

## 2026-03-13

### STRAT-COMP-6: Web Gate Resolution

- **Gate enrichment**: CLI populates `fromPhase`, `toPhase`, `artifact`, `round`, and `summary` on gate creation
- **Shared constants** (`lib/constants.js`): canonical `STEP_LABELS`, `GATE_ARTIFACTS`, and `buildGateSummary()` — single source for CLI and frontend
- **GateView enhancements**: summary display, artifact link (opens canvas), build-gate prominence (amber border, larger buttons when `flowId` present), feature grouping by `itemId`, collapsible gate history with count badge
- **Imperative outcome vocabulary**: `approve`/`revise`/`kill` throughout GateView, ItemDetailPanel, and resolve calls (legacy past-tense keys retained as fallbacks in color maps)
- **`gateCreated` event**: renamed from `gatePending`; `visionMessageHandler.js` and tests updated
- **URL-encoded gate IDs**: `encodeURIComponent(gateId)` in `useVisionStore.js` resolve calls and `visionMessageHandler.js` fetch
- **Idempotent re-resolve**: `POST /api/vision/gates/:id/resolve` returns 200 on already-resolved gates instead of 400
- **StratumPanel gate link**: gate list replaced with "View gates in sidebar" link using `sessionStorage` + custom event for cross-panel navigation
- **VisionTracker listener**: responds to `vision-view-change` event to switch sidebar view

### STRAT-COMP-4: Vision Store Unification

- **Canonical port resolution** (`lib/resolve-port.js`): `COMPOSE_PORT > PORT > 3001` used by all components
- **Server probe** (`lib/server-probe.js`): lightweight health check with timeout for dual-dispatch routing
- **Dual-dispatch VisionWriter**: routes mutations through REST when server is up, writes directly to disk when down
- **featureCode migration**: legacy `featureCode: "feature:X"` auto-migrated to `lifecycle.featureCode` on load
- **Gate outcome normalization**: canonical `approve`/`revise`/`kill` enforced at all write boundaries
- **Atomic writes**: temp file + `renameSync` in both VisionStore and VisionWriter
- **AD-4 gate delegation**: server stores gate state and broadcasts events; CLI owns all lifecycle transitions
- **Gate expiry persistence**: expired gates written to disk so restarts don't resurrect them
- **55 integration tests** across 5 test files covering all unification behaviors

### STRAT-COMP-5: Build Visibility

- **Atomic `active-build.json`**: writes via temp file + rename, extended fields (stepNum, totalSteps, retries, violations, status, startedAt)
- **Terminal state retention**: completed/aborted builds retain `active-build.json` on disk (overwritten on next build start)
- **`buildState` WebSocket handler**: `visionMessageHandler.js` handles `buildState` messages, updates `activeBuild` state
- **File watcher extension**: server watches `.compose/` directory for `active-build.json` changes

### STRAT-COMP-7: Agent Stream Bridge

- **`BuildStreamWriter`** (`lib/build-stream-writer.js`): appends JSONL events to `.compose/build-stream.jsonl` with monotonic `_seq` and ISO timestamps
- **`BuildStreamBridge`** (`server/build-stream-bridge.js`): watches JSONL file, maps CLI events to SSE-compatible shapes, broadcasts to AgentStream
- **Build instrumentation**: `build.js` creates `BuildStreamWriter` after plan/resume, writes `build_start`, `build_step_start`, `build_step_done`, `build_gate`, `build_gate_resolved`, `build_error`, and `build_end` events
- **Crash detection**: bridge emits synthetic `build_end(crashed)` after configurable timeout during active step
- **27 tests** covering writer, bridge, event mapping, crash detection, and stale file handling
