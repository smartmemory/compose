## Phase 4: Integration & UI Extensions — PARKED

Independent enhancements. No downstream phases depend on these. Parked in favor of
Phase 6.5/6.8/7 which are on the critical path.

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-GIT-1 | Git/file connector — link work items to code changes, diff awareness | PARKED |
| COMP-GIT-2 | File checkpoint/rewind — snapshot affected files before agent changes; rewind surface in UI | PARKED |
| COMP-UI-7 | Tab popout — dockable/undockable tabs to separate monitors *(UI extension)* | PARKED |
| COMP-VIS-1 | Live agent communication graph — animated packet flow on GraphView edges when agents message each other in real time; topology overlay showing active relays, message direction, and throughput *(inspired by Meridian)* | COMPLETE |

| — | Agent connector (read-write) — direct sessions from Compose | **SUPERSEDED by Phase 4.5** |

---

## Phase 4.5: Architecture Foundation — COMPLETE

**Scope boundary:** Delivers the connector *infrastructure* — class hierarchy, MCP tools, Stratum
harness. This is the engineering substrate. Phase 7 builds on this to make the lifecycle itself
agent-agnostic (swap Claude Code for Codex end-to-end). Phase 4.5 wires two specific connectors;
Phase 7 defines the protocol that makes connectors interchangeable.

Deliver the agent connector layer (ClaudeSDKConnector + CodexConnector as MCP tools) with
Stratum as the process harness. No new UI surface. Clean server modularization. Verified end-to-end.

See: [Architecture Foundation Plan](plans/2026-02-26-architecture-foundation-plan.md) for acceptance criteria on all 8 steps.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 18a | Architecture alignment — connector class hierarchy, delete codex-server.js, reshape connectors | COMPLETE |
| 18b | Integration surface stabilization — agent-mcp.js, `agent_run` MCP tool with `type` parameter (codex, claude, etc.), .mcp.json. **Acceptance:** `/compose` Phase 7 step 3 calls `agent_run(type="codex")` as default reviewer (Opus executes, Codex reviews) | COMPLETE |
| 18c | Stratum externalization — pipelines/ directory, review-fix.stratum.yaml, end-to-end run | COMPLETE |
| 18d | UI decoupling — verify zero new UI surface; VisionServer SSE stays sole UI channel | COMPLETE |
| 18e | Server modularization — split server/ into domain modules, single responsibility per file | COMPLETE |
| 18f | Test + observability hardening — golden flow tests for both MCP tools, Stratum audit trace | COMPLETE — unit tests (13) + agent-mcp golden flow tests (6) + live smoke tests pass |
| 18g | Cutover + cleanup — remove openai dep, dead code, dangling imports | COMPLETE |
| 18h | Acceptance gate — both tools callable; Stratum pipeline completes on a real feature | COMPLETE — review-fix pipeline ran end-to-end (claude execute → codex review → clean), audit trace written |

---

## Phase 5: Standalone — PLANNED

Compose as an installable tool: LaunchAgent, version-aware restart, CLI + npm distribution.

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-DIST-1 | Standalone app — LaunchAgent, version-aware restart, CLI + npm distribution | PLANNED |

---

## Phase 5.5: Skill Architecture Upgrade — COMPLETE

**Note on ordering:** Phase 5.5 completed before Phase 5 because it was a skill-layer concern
(agent definitions, review protocol) with no dependency on the standalone app. Half-phases are
parallel tracks that surface when significant work fits between two sequential phases. Completion
of 5.5 does not imply completion of 5; 19a (skill arch) and 19 (standalone) are independent.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 19a | Agent-based skill architecture — compose-explorer, compose-architect, compose-reviewer agents; competing architecture proposals; confidence-scored review; rename feature-dev → compose | COMPLETE |

---

## Phase 6: Lifecycle Engine — COMPLETE

The `/compose` skill becomes the product. Seven layers from user preferences through iteration
orchestration. See: [Lifecycle Engine Roadmap](plans/2026-02-15-lifecycle-engine-roadmap.md).

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 20 | User preferences inventory — config surface for feature toggles, policy defaults, agent settings | COMPLETE |
| 21 | Feature lifecycle state machine — explicit phase tracking per feature, event-driven transitions | COMPLETE |
| 22 | Artifact awareness — feature folder management, presence detection, templates, quality signals | COMPLETE |
| 23 | Policy enforcement runtime — gate/flag/skip dials as structural enforcement, not prose | COMPLETE — evaluatePolicy + build.js integration, settings-driven per-phase modes |
| 24 | Gate UI — interactive approve/revise/kill in Vision Surface, gate queue, trade-offs display | COMPLETE — GateView with policyMode badges, full history, revision feedback, multi-channel (bar/toast/ops/palette) |
| 25 | Session-lifecycle binding — sessions tagged to features and phases, contextualized activity | COMPLETE |
| 25a | Subagent activity nesting — hierarchical view of parallel compose agents in Vision Surface; each compose-explorer/architect instance visible as a child of the parent phase | COMPLETE — AgentRegistry + AgentPanel subagents section, persistent tracking, WebSocket events |
| 26 | Iteration orchestration — ralph loops as Compose primitive, completion promise monitoring, exit criteria enforcement | COMPLETE — 3 MCP tools, server-side exit criteria evaluation, max iteration enforcement, WS broadcasts |

---

## Phase 6.5: Pipeline Authoring Loop — PLANNED

**Note on ordering:** Phase 6.5 is a parallel track on the stratum-compose integration — the
closed loop between the embedded agent, the pipeline editor UI, and stratum execution. Independent
of Phase 6's lifecycle state machine work; both can progress simultaneously.

Close the loop between agent and UI so users can design, review, and execute pipelines without
leaving compose. Agent drafts → UI surfaces → user approves → stratum executes.

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-PIPE-1 | Pipeline template library — 7 templates with metadata blocks, `GET /api/pipeline/templates` + `/templates/:id/spec` endpoints, TemplateSelector UI | COMPLETE |
| COMP-PIPE-2 | Pipeline draft flow — REST-based draft CRUD with draftId concurrency, approve/reject lifecycle, approved specs to `.compose/data/approved-specs/` | COMPLETE |
| COMP-PIPE-3 | PipelineView live refresh — WS `pipelineDraft`/`pipelineDraftResolved` messages, three-mode PipelineView (empty/draft/active), version-aware step derivation | COMPLETE |

---

## Phase 6.8: Cross-Session Memory Layer — PLANNED

**Note on ordering:** SmartMemory (`/reg/my/SmartMemory`) is already registered as an MCP server
in compose's `.mcp.json` and session hooks (start/stop) already push episodic memories to it.
Phase 6.8 formalizes it as the canonical cross-session memory layer and closes the loop so the
agent actively consults memory at the start of each feature rather than treating it as ambient
background.

**SmartMemory fit:** lite mode (SQLite + usearch, no Docker) runs embedded. Memory types map
cleanly: `episodic` → session summaries, `decision` → architecture choices, `semantic` → discovered
patterns, `code` → indexed entities from blueprint research.

**Key idea:** pull-first catalog. Rather than injecting all memories into every
prompt, the agent receives a compact ranked catalog at feature start and retrieves full details on
demand. This keeps context bounded regardless of conversation history length.

**Implementation split:** SmartMemory owns the pull-first catalog tool (in progress). Compose
wires it in at skill entry — item 32 is integration work only, not a build.

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-MEM-1 | Memory catalog integration — wire SmartMemory's native pull-first catalog tool into compose skill entry; SmartMemory owns the implementation, compose calls it *(blocked on SmartMemory pull-first landing)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-MEM-2 | Feature-scoped memory ingestion — after each gate approval, ingest phase artifact (design.md, blueprint.md, decisions) into SmartMemory with `feature_id` tag; retrieval scoped to feature or cross-feature | PLANNED |
| COMP-MEM-3 | Compose skill entry integration — `/compose` skill calls `get_memory_catalog` before Phase 1; surfaces relevant prior decisions and patterns from similar past features | PLANNED |

---

## Phase 6.9: Agent Fleet Management — PLANNED

**Note on ordering:** Phase 6.9 is the operational robustness layer for multi-agent execution.
Phase 4.5 delivered agent connectors and spawn infrastructure. Phase 6 added lifecycle binding
and iteration orchestration. Phase 6.9 closes the gap between "agents can be spawned" and
"agents can be managed at scale" — health, resources, recovery, coordination, and parent-level
control skills. Prerequisite for Phase 7's trusted harness (harness needs interrupt, health,
and resource limits to enforce its authority over workers).

### Feature 1: Agent Lifecycle Control

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-AGT-1 | Agent interrupt & cancellation — two-path stop (spawned CLI via SIGTERM/SIGKILL, SDK via interrupt escalation); `POST /api/agent/:id/stop`; UI kill button | COMPLETE |
| COMP-AGT-2 | Health monitoring — stdout+stderr liveness probes; 60s silence warning, 5min auto-kill; terminal reason tracking | COMPLETE |
| COMP-AGT-3 | Resource limits — wall-clock timeout (10m default); memory RSS polling; disk quota per worktree (500MB) | COMPLETE |
| COMP-AGT-4 | Worktree garbage collection — .owner file ownership; orphan scan on start + 15min interval; `POST /api/agent/gc` | COMPLETE |

### Feature 2: Agent Coordination & Communication

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-AGT-5 | Parent-child RPC — structured message passing between parent and spawned agents; `sendMessage`/`receiveMessage` via agent-server; request-response pairing with correlation IDs | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-6 | Inter-task coordination — shared blackboard for parallel tasks; task-to-task wait semantics (`depends_on` at runtime, not just merge order); event bus for task completion signals | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-7 | Message ordering & delivery — WebSocket heartbeat (30s); message sequence numbers; buffered replay on reconnect; deduplication by message ID | PLANNED |

### Feature 3: Merge & Recovery

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-AGT-8 | Merge conflict recovery — pluggable merge strategies (apply-patch, 3-way merge, auto-rebase); retry with conflict context injected into agent prompt; manual resolution gate when auto-merge fails | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-9 | Graceful degradation & retry — transient failure retry (git timeouts, spawn failures) with exponential backoff; worktree fallback to shared-cwd with isolation warning; partial success reporting | PLANNED |

### Feature 4: Registry & Observability

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-AGT-10 | Agent registry queries — filter by status, type, time range, parent ancestry; `GET /api/agents?status=running&type=codex&since=1h`; indexed agent history beyond 50-entry cap | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-11 | Structured observability — correlation IDs across agent boundaries; per-agent duration/success/failure metrics; aggregate dashboard (spawn rate, merge conflict rate, avg task duration) | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-12 | Dependency pre-flight validation — validate `depends_on` references exist and form a DAG before dispatch; check `files_owned` isolation; reject malformed specs with actionable errors | PLANNED |

### Feature 5: Agent Templates & Parent Skills

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-AGT-13 | Agent template library — predefined agent patterns (code-reviewer, test-runner, docs-generator, security-auditor, refactorer) with tool restrictions, system prompts, and expected output schemas; selectable via `agent_run(type=...)` | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-14 | Agent capability registry — each agent type declares capabilities (tools, file access, write permissions); parent validates capabilities match task requirements before dispatch | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-15 | Root parent orchestration skill — `compose:manage-agents` skill for the root agent to spawn, monitor, coordinate, and collect results from subagents; integrates health, interrupt, RPC, and templates into a single control surface; replaces ad-hoc `Agent` tool calls with structured fleet management | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-16 | Parallel dispatch skill — `compose:parallel-dispatch` skill wrapping `parallel_dispatch` build step; parent agent describes tasks declaratively, skill handles worktree setup, topo ordering, merge, and conflict recovery; surfaces per-task progress via EventTimeline (COMP-UX-11) | PLANNED |
| COMP-AGT-17 | Agent state persistence — transactional state machine for agent lifecycle (spawn → running → result → stored); long-term agent history beyond 50 cap; session-indexed for correlation queries | PLANNED |

## Phase 7: Trusted Pipeline Harness — PLANNED (Post-V1)

**Scope boundary:** Phase 4.5 has CC as orchestrator — it calls `stratum_plan`, runs steps,
and calls `stratum_step_done` with self-reported results. This works but has a trust gap: the
agent reporting postcondition results is the same agent whose work is being evaluated.

Phase 7 moves orchestration out of any agent. A deterministic harness outside CC drives the
pipeline, verifies postconditions independently, and treats all agents (CC, Codex, others) as
workers that receive prompts and return outputs. No agent calls `stratum_step_done` — the
harness does, after verifying ground truth itself (run tests, check files, call a reviewer).

**The shift:**
- Phase 4.5: CC orchestrates, Stratum enforces what CC reports
- Phase 7: Harness orchestrates, Stratum enforces what harness verifies independently

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-HARNESS-1 | Pipeline runner — deterministic harness (`server/pipeline-runner.js`) that calls `stratum_plan`, dispatches steps to agent workers via `agent_run`, verifies postconditions independently, calls `stratum_step_done` | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-2 | Stagnation detection — track environmental delta (files changed, tests passing) across iterations; trigger warning/abort when agent produces high activity but zero progress over an observation window *(inspired by Agent-Harness)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-3 | Effort budget — per-step tool-call budget that depletes with each action; harness halts the step when budget exhausted, preventing unbounded exploration within a single iteration *(inspired by Agent-Harness)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-4 | Independent verification — harness runs tests, checks file existence, and calls a reviewer agent as a separate verification step; no agent self-reports pass/fail | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-5 | Anti-gaming verification — harness checks environmental delta before accepting structured results; rejects `clean: true` if no files changed since last iteration, rejects `passing: true` if test output unchanged. Persistent quality score across iterations that can go *down* on re-review — wontfix/suppress tactics widen the lenient/strict gap, actual improvement required to move the number *(inspired by Agent-Harness + Desloppify)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-6 | Tamper-evident audit — SHA256 hash-chained JSONL audit trail for all harness decisions; each entry references the hash of the previous entry for non-repudiation *(inspired by Agent-Harness)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-7 | Multi-agent routing — harness selects which connector (`claude`, `codex`, others) to use per step based on step type; executor and reviewer never the same agent | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-8 | Tiered evaluation — fast-loop evals (cheap per-iteration: did flagged files change? did targeted test pass?) before full gates (expensive: full codex review, full test suite); skip full gate when fast check fails *(inspired by Itera)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-HARNESS-9 | Iteration ledger — per-iteration JSONL log with mistake/fix/prevention rules; enriches iteration history beyond `{ n, result }` so the agent learns within a single review loop; ingested to SmartMemory via COMP-MEM-2 for cross-session learning *(inspired by Itera)* | PLANNED |
| COMP-DEBUG-1 | Debug discipline engine — fix-chain detection (iteration-level file tracking), trace evidence enforcement (2+ items with commands), cross-layer scope detection (structured scope_hint + keyword fallback), attempt counting with escalation (visual bugs at 2, all at 5). Health score dimension + always-on review lens + file-based debug ledger. Wired into build.js step_done handler. *(inspired by SmartMemory retro 2026-04-12)* | COMPLETE |

## Phase 8: Cinematic / Demo Tooling — PLANNED (Post-V1)

**Scope:** Produce high-fidelity video/demo footage of the live cockpit by driving the
real UI deterministically and exporting per-frame PNGs — instead of screen-capture +
bitmap zoom (blurry past ~2.5×, no live motion, fake camera).

Because the graph is a cytoscape canvas, `cy.zoom()/pan()/animate()` redraw vectors at
the target zoom — pixel-sharp at **any** level, with real scripted camera moves
(select node → pan → zoom into dependency cluster → pop the gate). The blocker is
determinism: fcose layout randomness, RAF/`Date.now` animation timing, and live
websocket data must all be made reproducible.

Filed off producing the Stratum/Compose 60s explainers; the current explainer cockpit
beat uses a hi-DPI still + Remotion zoom as a stopgap. This is the durable replacement.

| Code | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| COMP-CINE-1 | Cinematic route — hidden `?cinematic` route that loads a fixed fixture dataset with live websockets disabled, so scenes are reproducible | PLANNED |
| COMP-CINE-2 | Deterministic layout — run fcose once, freeze node positions, replay as `preset` layout so every render is identical | PLANNED |
| COMP-CINE-3 | Frame clock — drive all animation from an injected clock instead of RAF/`Date.now`. **Use an off-the-shelf time-override mechanism — `timecut`/`timesnap` (tungs) or CDP `HeadlessExperimental.beginFrame` / Playwright `page.clock` — rather than hand-rolling clock injection** | PLANNED |
| COMP-CINE-4 | Camera timeline API — `setCamera({ zoom, pan, selected }, frame)` so shots are scripted in code | PLANNED |
| COMP-CINE-5 | Frame-export harness — steps frames headless, writes sharp per-frame PNGs at 1920×1080 (≥2× for zoom headroom). **Consume the shared kit in `~/reg/my/movie-maker` (`MM-CINE-*`, built on `timecut`/CDP `beginFrame`) — do not build a Compose-only harness. This phase becomes "Compose cockpit implements the capture contract" (tracked as `MM-ADOPT-1`)** | PLANNED |
| COMP-CINE-6 | Docs + sample shot — documented usage and one scripted reference shot (e.g. select → pan → zoom into cluster → gate popover) | PLANNED |
